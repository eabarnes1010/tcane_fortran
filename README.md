# FORTRAN evaluation engine for Comparing Methods of Hurricane Forecast Uncertainty with Neural Networks
***
Evaluate pre-trained artificial neural networks to estimate consensus hurricane intensity and track errors, as well as the associated uncertainties of the network predictions.

## FORTRAN Code
***
This code was compiled and tested using:
*GNU Fortran (MinGW-W64 x86_64-ucrt-posix-seh, built by Brecht Sanders) 12.2.0
